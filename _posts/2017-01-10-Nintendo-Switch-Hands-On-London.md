## Nintendo Switch Press hands on event happening in London straight after Tokyo stream

Nintendo are having a hands on Switch press event around the world pretty much straight after the stream from Tokyo (Friday 13th Jan 2017 ~4am GMT).

I will be there to report on my hands on experience of the Nintendo Switch.
Be sure to subscribe to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxBmRV2zTAWia6ALrT_w5TQ) to see that (hopefully, if not live, then straight after the event).
Also keep any eye on [gadget guru twitter](https://twitter.com/gadgetGuruTechy) for updates from/on the event.
