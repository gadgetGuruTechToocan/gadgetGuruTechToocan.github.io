## HMD Global has announced a re-release of Nokia  3310

Back when a mobile phone for was nothing much more than just that (well more or less), the Nokia 3310 was launched.
What is a little disconcerting for those of us able to remember the release of the Nokia 3310, this was only in 2000. Although 17 years ago, there is something about that year being perceptually closer in the psyche, at least for some of us older folk it seems. Nevertheless either as a marketing ploy to generate interest in the flagging Nokia brand or the fact its been that magic amount of time automatically qualifying it for a remake/re-release.

HMD Global, a startup born out of the aftermath from the Microsoft acquisition of the mobile phone company, has the rights to sell the Nokia brand world wild and announced this reboot of a classic phone at Mobile World Congress on February 26th 2017.
HMD Global's announcement is for a remake of the phone, with some welcome difference and some features expected to be added but not.

Definitely the release of this phone along with a raft of other Nokia smartphones more akin to modern expectations has done wonders for the press coverage of Nokia's return to the ring. Is the Nokia 3310 rerelease just that? A PR exercise to get more inches of coverage in the press? Maybe, but it is false to consider that the phone has just been thrown out there without some features to make it bare-able in our modern age. Albeit the sin of no wifi may prove ultimately otherwise.
