So Nintendo finally had their live stream from Tokyo. Where president Tatsumi kimishina was on hand to introduce us in more detail to Nintendos answer to the next generation of home games console. A console with a difference, rather than being just purely a home console (WiiU) or a console for portable gaming console (3DS), this console is both in one.
